This is a Helpdesk Tickets readme file
Building up a repository was a tough task
Linking it to the pycharm project was another challenge. The` bigger challenge was to link local Github desktop, onlione repository and then pycharm.
Making a file on pycharm and licnking it to the main py directory/file was quite confusing and took a few days to understand multiple happenings.
Coding itself is quite delicate job, which poses challenges if you are not teh master of all the problems.
So, learning tpo codfe with mistakes is hard.
I missed alot of code learning work to put on rerpository owing to the file creation at both Github and pycharm and importing and linking all together.
Put names of the users
Practiced open and close tickets.
Worked on the open and close number of helpdesk tickets.
Statistics of open and close tickets emerged with problems of linking the ticket lists to the statistic block.
With search and hit and trial, linked tickets list with the count statics.
Printed the status of open and close tickets, alongwith the ticket creation and discription.
