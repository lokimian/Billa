This is a Helpdesk Tickets readme file.
Prepared for Assignmet-2 of IT5016D. The project name is Lokimian under which the file Billa is set up.
Building up a repository was a tough task, as it needed abit more of skills and perhaps an exposure to run a repository under supervision.
Linking it to the pycharm project was another challenge. The` bigger challenge was to link local Github desktop, on-lione repository and then pycharm and operation a successful ineraction.
Making a file on pycharm and linking it to the "main py directory/file" was quite confusing and took a few days to understand multiple happenings.
Coding itself is quite delicate job, which poses challenges if you are not the capable of handling or trouble shooting the problems. Various problems poped up to be resolved, but resolution didnot happen before making the troubles further complex.
So, learning of coding with self mistakes is hard, as the understanding level is not high.
I missed a lot of code learning work to be put onthe repositor. Facing confusion and lack of practice, the file creation at both Github and pycharm, as well as importing and linking them all together and then operating accordingly required really hard work and great patience. Indeed, its a hard pathway of learning.
On user creation function, put names of the users, emails and ID, to recognise the tickets with users' identity.
Practiced open and close tickets, to see if the program, so far, is working with desired outcome.
Worked on the open and close number of helpdesk tickets.
Statistics of open and close tickets emerged with problems of linking the ticket lists to the statistic block.
With search, trying hit and trial, worked out to link ticket dictionary/tickets list with the count statics.
Printed the status of open and close tickets, alongwith the ticket creation and description. 
Ticket open and closed count status printed with one ticket closed.
Addressed the typo error found in the codes, then error correction and another practice of closing a  ticket
Setting up sign in with email and ID. problem came with 'tciket_id'. Working done on smoothing the signing in process for closing a ticket. 
Creation of the signing in of the users, after handling with repeatedly popping up errors in developing print commands.
Change in users ID tried with different styles, which was not working. Then User Sign in practised, alongwith Ticket creation, with new ID and signing in details.
One ticket closed with Ticket 3 and ID and obtained the status total of open and close tickets
Password change function for users worked on. The practice done with incorrect password with a result of "incorrect existing password".
Set up of password change work checked and successfully changed the user pass word.
