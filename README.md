Building up a repository was a tough task
Linking it to the pycharm project was another challenge. The` bigger challenge was to link local Github desktop, onlione repository and then pycharm.
Making a file on pycharm and licnking it to the main py directory/file was quite confusing and took a few days to understand multiple happenings.
Coding itself is quite delicate job, which poses challenges if you are not teh master of all the problems.
So, learning tpo codfe with mistakes is hard.
I missed alot of code learning work to put on rerpository owing to the file creation at both Github and pycharm and importing and linking all together.
