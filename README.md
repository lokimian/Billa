This is a Helpdesk Tickets readme file
Building up a repository was a tough task
Linking it to the pycharm project was another challenge. The` bigger challenge was to link local Github desktop, onlione repository and then pycharm.
Making a file on pycharm and linking it to the main py directory/file was quite confusing and took a few days to understand multiple happenings.
Coding itself is quite delicate job, which poses challenges if you are not the master of handling or trouble shooting the problems.
So, learning of coding with self mistakes is hard, as the understanding level is not high.
I missed a lot of code learning work to put on rerpository, owing to the file creation at both Github and pycharm, as well as importing and linking them all together and then operating accordingly. Indeed, its a hard pathway of learning.
Put names of the users, to recognise the tickets with users identity.
Practiced open and close tickets, to see if the programm, so far, is working with desired outcome.
Worked on the open and close number of helpdesk tickets.
Statistics of open and close tickets emerged with problems of linking the ticket lists to the statistic block.
With search, trying hit and trial, worked out to link ticket dictionary/tickets list with the count statics.
Printed the status of open and close tickets, alongwith the ticket creation and discription. 
Ticket open and closed count status printed with one tcket closed.
Addressed the typo error found in the codes, then error correction and another practice of closing a  ticket
Setting up sign in with email and ID. problem came with 'tciket_id'. Working on smooting the sign in process for closing a ticket. 
Creation of the signing in of the users, after handling with repeatedly poping up the errors in deveolping print commands.
